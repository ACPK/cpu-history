CPU Mon:
- get it to build @done
- make another pass through the source to take out extraneous references to CPUUsage
- check TODOs
- switch the source of the graph from memory info to CPU info:
	- first test data coming out of cpu info with logs (this might hurt. limit to one sample every 2 sec)
	- then change graphing fct to pull from different data source
- remove extraneous information for memory monitor:
	- paging rate graph
	- text overlay
	- preferences form
